   <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I currently live in the Columbia River Yacht Club, in the very boathouse once owned by Charles and Sharon Schlosser. The tranquility of the river, juxtaposed with the grim history it harbors, creates a unique and haunting atmosphere. As I settled into this community, I became deeply intrigued by Sharon's story—a mystery that has lingered in the collective memory of those who knew her. This narrative is a blend of the details I've gathered from archived articles and my reflections living in this space.</p>
<img src="path/to/boathouse.jpg" alt="Boathouse" class="img-fluid" style="float:right; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;">
<p>When I first moved into the boathouse, I was aware of its history but not the depth of the tragedy. Sharon Frances Schlosser, a vibrant and well-loved member of the community, disappeared on October 20, 1992. She was last seen leaving her home in Clackamas, supposedly heading for a business meeting in Mount Vernon, Washington. Six days later, her body was found floating in the Columbia River, a discovery that shocked and saddened the entire community.</p>

<p>The investigation into Sharon's death was marred by confusion and suspicion from the outset. Charles Schlosser, her husband, reported her missing the day after she disappeared. His inconsistent statements and reluctance to fully cooperate with detectives only fueled suspicion. His sons also became persons of interest when they invoked their Fifth Amendment rights during the grand jury proceedings.</p>

<p>Sharon’s mother, Agnes Mahoney, became the face of the quest for justice. For years, she placed small ads in the obituary section of The Oregonian on Sharon's birthday, pleading for any information that could lead to her daughter's killer. These ads were not just a call for help but a poignant reminder that Sharon’s murder remained unsolved. Agnes's dedication to keeping her daughter's memory alive is both inspiring and heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Living in the Schlosser's former boathouse has given me a unique perspective on this story. The serene environment often contrasts sharply with the grim events that unfolded here. Each ripple in the water, each gust of wind, seems to whisper fragments of the past. I frequently think about Sharon and the unresolved questions that still linger. Her family's unwavering quest for justice has deeply moved me, compelling me to delve further into her story.</p>

<p>My goal now is to piece together as much of Sharon’s story as possible. I plan to interview her children, investigators, and others who remember her. The archived articles provide a foundation, but I believe personal accounts will add invaluable depth to this narrative. Understanding the human side of this tragedy is crucial—not just for the story I hope to tell but for honoring Sharon’s memory.</p>
     <h2>The Tragic Case of Sharon Schlosser</h2>
     <p>On October 20, 1992, Sharon Schlosser departed from Clackamas, Oregon, heading to Mount Vernon, Washington, but never arrived. A week later, her body was found in the Columbia River, her death determined to be a homicide due to severe head injuries. Suspicion fell on her husband, Charles M. Schlosser, although no criminal charges have been filed against him. A witness claimed Charles had offered him a Corvette and money to kill Sharon, further fueling the suspicions.</p>
    
    <h2>Legal Battles and Investigations</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of Sharon's death, several legal actions ensued. A federal civil trial concerning her life insurance ended inconclusively. Sharon's family also filed a wrongful death suit against Charles, alleging he orchestrated her murder and tried to protect his assets from a civil judgment.</p>
   
   <h2>Family's Quest for Justice</h2>
    <p>Sharon's children from a previous marriage have led the charge for justice, asserting Charles’s involvement in their mother’s murder. Their relentless pursuit is driven by a desire for criminal accountability and to honor Sharon's memory.</p>

    <h2>Key Figures in the Case</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Detective Pieter Van Dyke - Investigated the circumstances of Sharon's death and Charles Schlosser's statements.</li>
        <li>Detective Karl Hutchison - Involved in the case.</li>
        <li>Gary Muncy - Sheriff's detective assigned to the case.</li>
        <li>Sam Hooson - Testified regarding Charles Schlosser's alleged murder proposition involving a Corvette and $2,000.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Living in the Columbia River Yacht Club has been an immersive experience, one that ties me to Sharon Schlosser’s tragic tale. As I continue to explore her story, I am committed to shedding light on the details that have remained in the shadows for far too long. This is not just about writing a book; it's about bringing a sense of closure and justice for Sharon and her family.</p>
