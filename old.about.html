        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>My name is Danielle Phillips, and my husband Randy and I embarked on an unexpected adventure when we purchased our first boat and the boathouse to keep it in at the <a href="https://www.cryc.com/">Columbia River Yacht Club</a>. Initially hesitant to join a yacht club due to preconceived notions of elitism, we were pleasantly surprised to discover a welcoming community of fellow boating enthusiasts who quickly became like family.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>My professional background spans over 25 years in the tech industry, where I've worked with start-ups and Fortune 500 companies in roles ranging from engineering to product management. Currently, I am a Product Manager at Intel in Hillsboro. This career has instilled in me a cross-functional work style and a passion for problem-solving and community building.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>Living in the boathouse formerly owned by Charles and Sharon Schlosser has deeply connected me to Sharon’s tragic story. As I learned more about the unsolved mystery of her death, I felt compelled to write about it, not only to honor her memory but also to support her family's enduring quest for justice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>Through my writing, I aim to shed light on Sharon's life and the events surrounding her untimely death. I hope to gather insights from those who knew her, including her children, investigators, and community members, to piece together a narrative that does justice to her story and keeps her memory alive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bio-section">
            <p>This journey has not only deepened my appreciation for the vibrant community at the yacht club but also strengthened my resolve to contribute positively to the lives of those around me. I invite you to join me in exploring this poignant tale and in seeking the closure that Sharon’s family so deeply deserves.</p>
