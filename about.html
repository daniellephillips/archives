     <h1>The Tragic Case of Sharon Schlosser</h1>
     <p class="lead">
       The mysterious death of Sharon Francis Schlosser, whose body turned up in the Columbia River on October 27. Included is a link to a PDF with various articles focused on this tragic story and unresolved murder. Here's a summary of the key points and key figures:
Sharon Schlosser's Murder: Sharon was found dead in the Columbia River in October 1992. The case was labeled a homicide, with Sharon having died from head injuries. The primary suspect in her murder was her husband, Charles Schlosser. Still, no criminal charges have been filed against him despite the testimony of a witness who claims Charles Schlosser offered him a Corvette and a few thousand dollars to kill Sharon. This plan was said to be almost identical to the way Sharon Schlosser died​. Additionally, there is a good amount of compelling circumstantial evidence.
Legal Battles and Investigations: The case saw several legal proceedings, including a federal civil trial over Sharon's life insurance policy and a wrongful death lawsuit filed by her family against Charles Schlosser. The life insurance policy case ended in a hung jury. At the same time, the wrongful death suit accused Charles of causing Sharon's death and transferring his property to avoid paying a civil judgment.
Family's Quest for Justice: Sharon's children from a previous marriage have been actively seeking justice. Despite the lack of criminal charges, they remained convinced of Charles Schlosser's involvement in their mother's death. They expressed disappointment at the outcomes of the trials but remained hopeful for a criminal conviction. Sharon's mother, Agnes "Aggie" Mahoney, was particularly active in keeping her daughter's memory alive and seeking justice.
Continuing Investigation: Despite the passage of time, the investigation into Sharon Schlosser's murder has remained active, with law enforcement continuing to consider Charles Schlosser as a suspect. The case has been before grand juries, but sufficient evidence for an indictment has not been found.
Key Figures: 
Sheriff's Detective Pieter Van Dyke and was involved in the investigation of Sharon Schlosser's case, specifically in examining the circumstances of her death and Charles Schlosser's statements​.
Detective Karl Hutchison
Gary Muncy, sheriff's detective assigned to the case as of the last news article. 
Sam Hooson testified that Charles Schlosser offered him a Corvette and $2,000 to kill Sharon Schlosser with a hammer at a boathouse. He worked for Schlosser painting vehicles on Schlosser's used truck lot on Southeast 82nd Avenue.
